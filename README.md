## Introduction 
--The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in an unprecedented manner, and as such, we have made a project which shows COVID 19 stats daily of the state and city requested by the user. The stats are sent everyday to the email id provided by the user. It is a simple and easy to use website which takes inputs such as email ID, State and City from the user and the total number of cases, number of recoveries, active cases and number of deaths are sent via email to the user.

## Project Design
Python\Selenium\HTML\CSS\JS\Flask
Used 
* Python for server-side programming as it has dynamic web creation capabilites.
* Selenium for web scrapping. Extracted data from (https://www.grainmart.in/news/covid-19-coronavirus-india-state-and-district-wise-tally/) and stored it as a CSV file.
* HTML,CSS and JS in frontend web development for formatting and making the content interactable. 
* Flask which is Self-defined as a microframework, is tailored to small-scale solutions, hence used it for backend web development. 


### The project is hosted on [heroku](https://corona-stats-emailer.herokuapp.com/)
